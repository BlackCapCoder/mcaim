Somehow Minecraft has controller support, but no way to bind looking around to the keyboard. This is a super simple mod that:

1. Adds keybindings for looking around (hjkl is default)
2. Adds a key for targeting the mob closest to where you are looking. It is essentially a aimbot, which is necessary because of the stepwise nature of the keyboard controls. (g is default)


### TODO:

* Adjust the targeting while holding a bow (this is non-trivial with modded ranged weapons)
* Some kind of logic for looking at blocks of interest
